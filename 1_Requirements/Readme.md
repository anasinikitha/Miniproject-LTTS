* This mini project on Department Store Management System exposes my understanding and implementation level in multiple C programming concepts. In this project, you can manage a typical ‘fashion wear’ department store. You can add goods, edit goods, search, delete and display the goods.

* File handling has been used to record the information (rate, quantity, name and code) of the added goods. You can search the goods by rate, code or quantity. And, similar goes for display; you can display the items by quantity, rate or code.
